# SemanticsDigitalLibrary_project
This is the repository for the Semantic Digital library project: Raimondi's notebooks '24
This project is part of the 2023/2024 Semantic Digital Library course taught by Prof.Giovanni Colavizza at the University of Bologna. This project aims to create a model capable of recognising the handwriting of Giuseppe Raimondi, a writer from Bologna who lived between the late 19th century and the late 1980s. The model was made using technology provided by Transkribus, a comprehensive platform for digitization, text creation with the help of artificial intelligence, automatic transcription, and research of historical documents.
